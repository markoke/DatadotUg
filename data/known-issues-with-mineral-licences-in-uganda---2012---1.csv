It is a requirement when filling the application form to indicate in the application a person qualified to comply with the mining regulations.(b) This licence was transferred with the consent of the Commissioner on 15/12/2007 after change of the company whose details were not established.(c) The calculation of annual rent is not shown in the black minute. It should be based on square kilometer of the area licensed. The amount so calculated is then used in preparing Bank Payment Advise Form (BPAF). This step is missing.(d) Last renewal of this licence was in April 2011.(e) Black minutes show no activity since the last renewal in April 2011. (f) No Memorandum and Articles of Association filed(a) Officers in Mines Division to ensure that all applications are fully filed as shown in the application. Where this not done the application should not be processed until it is completed.(b) It is a good practice that where a company is a licencee, the existence of it has to be confirmed. This could be by certified copies of the Memorandum and Articles of Association. The GSMD should always confirm the existence of a Company.(c) The assessed or calculation of fees should be plainly stated in the black minute. Where a BPAF is issued and receipt of funds, copies of these documents must be filed on the very file.(d) It should be the practice of the department to find out why the licencee is failing to submit returns and why there is no activity reported. This practice enables the department to know the hardships licencees face. It will help the department to know whether the area could be given to another applicant with the ability to perform. "
